autoproxy
=========

Autoproxy is a Java library to auto detect the platform network proxy settings. Note this library is a fork of
[proxy-vole](https://code.google.com/p/proxy-vole/) by Bernd Rosstauscher hosted at Google Code.

Introduction
------------

The library provides some proxy setting search strategies to read the proxy settings from the system config 
(Windows, KDE, Gnome, OSX), browser config (Firefox, IE), or environment variables, ... and provides you an ready to use proxy selector.

Java wants to be "The Internet Programming" language and wants to stay relevant for desktop applications / the RIA market.
This can only be achieved with painless out of the box internet connectivity.

Why a fork?
-----------
I don't like the name
Google Code is retired by now
